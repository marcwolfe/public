# Marc Wolfe TEECOM Solution

## Technologies Used

1. JavaScript
2. HTML
3. StarWars API

## Instructions
I cloned the original repository that was sent to me and completed the project in a way where the solution just prints to the developer console, so the only steps needed to take to see the information is to 
1. Clone the repository. 
2. Open the index.html file in your browser. 
3. Open the developer console and tada! 

### Thought Process
Upon learning that the project required interaction with an API, I first utilized the documentation to familiarize myself with the API. My next step was to make a few fetch requests to different endpoints to familiarize myself with the data structure. I then decided to hit the API endpoint for 'people' and would filter out certain individuals based on the projects requirements. I was initially stumped on how to access the 'homeplanet' endpoint for an individual because the data returned was another API. Then I had the idea to try another fetch request to pull out the data from the 'planets' endpoint and to my surprise it worked! Lastly I just used basic JavaScript principles such as a 'for loop and map' to iterate over the data and display the correct information in the developer console. 

### Random Thoughts
I used JavaScript mainly because it is my strongest language and I wanted to put my best foot forward. I contemplated using axios to do the fetch request but I ended up not doing it, mainly because I have only used axios once for another project and did not want to get caught up learning a new technology with the  time limit. The most difficult part was realizing that I could do a second fetch request to pull the data for the planets but once I realized that it was smooth sailing. I am really thankful for the opportunity to show my skills and I look forward to meeting the team and getting to learn more everything! The

p.s. This challenge was awesome and I LOVE StarWars and FYI apparently you can return the data in 'Wookie' language if you play around in the documentation and I thought that was pretty awesome.

### Questions 
1. While my solution was successful, I am aware that there may be a more efficient way to get the solution and I wanted to know if I could get some insight to what I could do better?
2. I printed the solution in the developer console mainly because thats what I am most comfortable using and was not sure if that was what was meant by the command line. I wonder if maybe I could have accomplished the same thing using nodeJS in the terminal but I hope I am not too penalized for that mixup?
3. Would love to get as much feedback as possible from the team on this challenge. I am hungry to become the best developer I can and anything feedback positive or constructive would be great.
