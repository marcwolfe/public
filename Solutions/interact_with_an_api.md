# Interact with an API
## Approach
For this assessment, please provide a solution to the following request:

**List the unique home-worlds of the characters in Attack of the Clones,
including their `name`, `population`, and the `characters` from that
planet.**

For example, if we were to do this exercise on The Expanse, a solution
might be:

| Name     | Pop.  | Characters                   |
|----------|-------|------------------------------|
| Earth    | a lot | James Holden, Amos Burton    |
| Mars     | less  | Alex Kamal, Bobby Draper     |
| The Belt | many  | Naomi Negata, Camina Drummer |

Use the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev) to write a script that prints the answer in the command line.
The API is language-agnostic as well as [well-documented](https://swapi.dev/documentation), and you are welcome to use any language.
We expect you to interface with the API directly.
Solutions using general helper libraries are acceptable, 
but please do not use any libraries designed specifically for the SWAPI API.

## Delivery
We require a minimum of 2 files, the solution and README, for a completed technical assessment.
You have 2 days from when you receive the instructions to address and provide the completed assessment.
Within this timeframe, the time taken to submit the assessment will have no impact on evaluation.
For example, if the instructions are received on 1/1, an assessment submitted on 1/2 will be evaluated identically to one submitted  on 1/3. 

### Solution file(s)
This should include all the code used to find your solution.
We should be able to run this file using the README's instructions.
From the command line, we expect the solution file(s) to generate the answer. 

### README.md
The README should include instructions, your thought process, and any questions.
Instructions should have clear directions to run the code from the command line. 
Any dependencies should be documented, as well as how to acquire them.
Include the process you took to tackle the problem, and how you attained your solution.
Any details related to the design of your solution should be included here.

Some details that may be helpful to include, but are by no means required: 
- Any tradeoffs that you considered
- A reason for the choice of language, frameworks, and libraries, if there is a compelling reason
- Areas you may have found more difficult to solve, or did not solve

### Completed Assessment Delivery
Upload your solution in the following Dropbox [link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/gcX0Q9Eh06iY3Yz4fDON).


## Notes from Team
This assessment is designed for the team to see your programming style and experience.
Submitting an incomplete assessment does not directly result in disqualification. 
We take experience into consideration when evaluating the completion of the solution.
